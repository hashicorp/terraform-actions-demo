# GitHub Actions Demo with Terraform

This is a simple example Terraform repo to demonstrate Terrafrom usage with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). You can take a look at the actions workflow by looking at the [.github/main.workflow file](.github/main.workflow), or select the `actions` tab to view the previous runs.
